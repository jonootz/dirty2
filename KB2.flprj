If you intend to use Flare to generate an online Knowledge Base, this project demonstrates one approach you may consider. This template starts you out with an HTML5 target and a skin that has responsive output enabled. This means the content display changes automatically depending on the device (browser, tablet, or mobile phone). You can add other kinds of targets if you like."
